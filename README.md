# pitunes
Pitunes was my Project for the Hackathon i went to in September 2024.

It uses the Spotipy library, which gets you full access to all of the music data provided by the spotify platform.
It gets the input for a spotify artist,  searches through spotify and displays the 5 most famous songs (or Album) on a st7735.
